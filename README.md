## üì© Installing
**NOTE: You WILL need a JAILBROKEN (GoldHen 2.3.0+) PS4 in order to play this mod on console. We hope this is clear.**

download the latest release of the [GoldHEN plugins repository.](https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN_Plugins_Repository/releases/latest) install that to your PS4 following the instructions found [here.](https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN_Plugins_Repository#quick-start)

Download [**Rock Band 4 Deluxe**](#-downloads), Extract the zip somewhere on your PC.

Once that is complete, open the folder called `GoldHEN`.

Copy the `plugins` folder and `plugins.ini` file to `/data/GoldHEN/` on your PS4 or edit your current `plugins.ini` file to add these lines

```ini
; Rock Band 4 Deluxe Plugins
;US
[CUSA02084]
/data/GoldHEN/plugins/RB4DX-Plugin.prx
/data/GoldHEN/plugins/no_share_watermark.prx
;EU
[CUSA02901]
/data/GoldHEN/plugins/RB4DX-Plugin.prx
/data/GoldHEN/plugins/no_share_watermark.prx
```

after that, copy the `RB4DX` folder to your ps4 also in the folder `/data/GoldHEN/`.

If there is a `ps4` folder already in the `RB4DX` folder on your ps4, delete it before copying.

### Optional Additions

*Rock Band 4 Deluxe* Comes with many goodies to change/improve the game

All of them can be found in the dx_optional_additions folder in the download for RB4DX.

To install these, copy the `ps4` folder inside each optional addition to your ps4 in the folder `/data/GoldHEN/RB4DX/` **AFTER** copying the main rb4dx ps4 folder.
